# ECG_anomalities

In this project, we tried to study ECG excerpts to classify different types of heartbeat.
We classify it in two categories : abnormal and normal heartbeat.

# Datasource

Our source of data is a group of ECG recordings provided by the MIT and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
It's an open source archive that contains 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings.
These excerpts are about a group of person wich have different forms of arrhythmia. Some of them didn't have this pathology.
